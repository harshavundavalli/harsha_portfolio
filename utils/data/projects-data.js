Utilized YOLOv8 for object detection and a simplified DeepSORT tracker for maintaining unique IDs across frames. Optimized for Apple Silicon (macOS), the system provides both a desktop interface and a web dashboard with live video feed and tracking logs, while also supporting custom YOLO model training for domain-specific applications.",
